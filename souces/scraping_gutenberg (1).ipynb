            "You said the same yesterday.” “Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness.\n",
            "“Legal documents are written like that to this day.” “Legal?\n",
            "“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were arranged yesterday.\n",
            "In spite of her eighteen years, she looked almost a little girl—almost a child.\n",
            "You were speaking about it yesterday.” “Yes... well?” Razumihin’s eyes opened wide.\n",
            "I was speaking of you yesterday.\n",
            "“I have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years.\n",
            "“Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.” “Polenka?\n",
            "“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday.\n",
            "“I only came to town the day before yesterday.\n",
            "“Two or three days before her death it must have been.\n",
            "“Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily.\n",
            "All last week he was begging me to introduce him to you.\n",
            "He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday.\n",
            "So that’s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I’ve found a treasure!\n",
            "I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.\n",
            "They got on to everlasting questions, floated off into space.” “Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday.\n",
            "He took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them.\n",
            "And the things he said yesterday!\n",
            "Last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two months.\n",
            "Two months ago?\n",
            "It’s only signed with an initial.” “I only learnt it by chance, the other day.\n",
            "I feel vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the restaurant....” “Damn it!\n",
            "“They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?” Raskolnikov made no reply.\n",
            "“It was yesterday, I know.\n",
            "I only arrived myself the day before.\n",
            "Ah, the golden days of our youth, where are they?).\n",
            "“I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?” he asked.\n",
            "I’ve been lounging about for the last three days, and I’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me.\n",
            "I’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town it is!\n",
            "There was a regular set of us, men of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time.\n",
            "You know she was five years older than I.\n",
            "For seven years I never left the country.\n",
            "I saw her first on the very day of the funeral, an hour after she was buried.\n",
            "It was the day before I left to come here.\n",
            "All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if I forgot it she would always remind me.\n",
            "The next day I set off on my way here.\n",
            "I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year ago.\n",
            "Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was done in my presence.\n",
            "In spite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday.\n",
            "One day the girl was found hanging in the garret.\n",
            "Your son,” he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “yesterday in the presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or...\n",
            "For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had gone on waiting and amassing money.\n",
            "The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled.\n",
            "A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively conversation.\n",
            "For nearly two years I’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every detail of their business.\n",
            "It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter.\n",
            "Only last week!\n",
            "Only a week before his death.\n",
            "They just reminded her of her old happy days.\n",
            "Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping suddenly before her.\n",
            "“In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse!\n",
            "I was at church last week, too...\n",
            "She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St. John.\n",
            "“Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection, at the last day.\n",
            "And some day later on, in years to come, you’ll understand perhaps what they meant.\n",
            "This conjecture had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his alarm and despair.\n",
            "“This is beyond the cat playing with a mouse, like yesterday.\n",
            "Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been.\n",
            "You said yesterday you were not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about it!\n",
            "From Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday.\n",
            "His yesterday’s visitor?\n",
            "To-day,” he repeated to himself.\n",
            "The door opened gently and slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure—yesterday’s visitor from underground.\n",
            "And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for you....” “Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.\n",
            "We have carried on our trade in that house for years past.\n",
            "So this was the solution of yesterday’s horror.\n",
            "And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day.\n",
            "“Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago.\n",
            "But what if it were the fourth, what if it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense!\n",
            "“I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman.\n",
            "All this happened yesterday evening.\n",
            "On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of my lodging!\n",
            "She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she had done the day before.\n",
            "“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.\n",
            "Do you remember what I said yesterday?” Again she did not answer.\n",
            "“You remember what I meant to tell you yesterday?” Sonia waited uneasily.\n",
            "“Well, here I’ve come to tell you.” “Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty.\n",
            "“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.” “Go where?” asked Sonia timidly.\n",
            "Yesterday when I said it I did not know where.\n",
            "I will tell you some day how I went!\n",
            "Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but to-day things are going better.\n",
            "“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at me,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly.\n",
            "His head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three days.\n",
            "Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday.\n",
            "But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had a bite for three days.\n",
            "“I was talking with my sister—the day before yesterday, I think it was—about you, Razumihin.” “About me!\n",
            "But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?” Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.\n",
            "Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air.\n",
            "It was his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day.\n",
            "Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen.\n",
            "It’s half-past four now.\n",
            "I know what you’re thinking, that she’s the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter.\n",
            "I do no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time.\n",
            "The first day I came here I visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them.\n",
            "And that’s humiliating for a young man of any pride, in our day especially....” “But remorse?\n",
            "I have money, I can get a ticket in three days.\n",
            "“What, at five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror.\n",
            "Ah, how muddy you are.” “I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began.\n",
            "He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding months.\n",
            "For the first time after all those awful months his heart was softened.\n",
            "“I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna.\n",
            "Killing her was atonement for forty sins.\n",
            "Would not twenty years of continual bondage crush him utterly?\n",
            "Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives—Siberia or...\n",
            "Raskolnikov had not been here since that day.\n",
            "He’s not been here since yesterday... he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way.\n",
            "In the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months.\n",
            "Almost a year and a half has passed since his crime.\n",
            "Five months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced.\n",
            "Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before.\n",
            "Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin.\n",
            "They were continually making plans for the future; both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least.\n",
            "A quarrel broke out one day, he did not know how.\n",
            "Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents of pies and rolls.\n",
            "The second week after Easter had come.\n",
            "There were warm bright spring days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened.\n",
            "Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily.\n",
            "Again it was a warm bright day.\n",
